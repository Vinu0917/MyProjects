                Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents one of the most transformative technologies of our time. At its core, AI refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The field has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1950s, moving from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated learning algorithms that can adapt and improve over time.

                The foundations of AI encompass several key concepts: machine learning, which enables systems to learn from data; knowledge representation, which allows machines to store and manipulate information; problem-solving techniques that help AI navigate complex scenarios; and natural language processing, which facilitates human-computer interaction through everyday language. Understanding these fundamentals provides the groundwork for exploring more advanced AI applications and technologies.
